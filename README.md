# Data-Analyst-Job-Posting
A SQL project using a dataset that pulls job postings from Google's search results for Data Analyst positions

## Data Analyst Job Postings (SQL Based)



## Introduction

This SQL project is based on [Data Analyst Job Postings [Pay, Skills, Benefits]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search) dataset  hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

This repository provides an SQL analysis of employment listings scraped from Google job search results. The dataset spans from November 4, 2022 through September 9, 2023 using PosgreSQL within a Docker container. 

The goal of this analysis is to gain insight into the skills that are frequently mentioned in the job descriptions, frequency of job postings and basic salary statistics.

## Datasets
The complete, updated daily dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search).  Github restricts file sizes to under 100mb.  Because of this restriction, I have split the current CSV (2022-11-04 through 2023-09-09)  into standard calendar quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).

- <strong>gsearch_jobs_2022.csv</strong>: 
- <strong>gsearch_jobs_2023_q1.csv</strong>: (Jan/Feb/Mar 2023)
- <strong>gsearch_jobs_2023_q2.csv</strong>: (Apr/May/Jun 2023)
- <strong>gsearch_jobs_2023_q3.csv</strong>: (Jul/Aug/Sep 2023)
